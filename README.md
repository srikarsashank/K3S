# K3S# chat app
We actually tried hard to finish a chat application using html,css,JS,node.jsand socket.io
But we could hardly make things on frontend and tried a little bit of backend like creating a server and a chat box whose pics are put in the K3S repository.(the pics can be seen in the files uploaded chatbox.jpg and server.jpg)
All the people who has a username and password can login and chat with others,and people who are connected to this server can send messages to server and we can view it.(just tried to make like this but couldn't actually,but sure will try to make it by another one week).
Actually tried hard to learn how to maintain a database for the login and users but everything went above my head and hardly made something.
Special thanks to RUT BHAYYA for giving such a good task.
